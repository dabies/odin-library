# odin-library
Library Web App project
Did not realize this would be a full project, so unfortunately didn't create a repo
until I had already finished with it. Really disappointed in myself, because the
project turned out great and would have been wonderful for my portfolio but I fear
it will be worthless without the trail of git commits. Good lesson to learn I guess.
